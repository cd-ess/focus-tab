# Focus Tab

**Focus Tab** is a minimalist browser extension that helps you stay focused by temporarily closing distracting tabs and restoring them later.

## How It Works

1. Select either **Blacklist** or **Whitelist** mode.
2. Add sites to block (e.g. `youtube.com`, `reddit.com`).
3. Click **Close Distracting Tabs**.
4. The extension closes matching tabs and remembers them.
5. You can **Reopen Tabs** manually or wait 30 minutes for them to reopen automatically.
